            <p class = 'dish_intro'> Tomato egg stir fry is a very popular dish in Taiwanese and Chinese cuisine.
                It is very simple and quick to make and is a personal favorite of mine; whenever I am in a rush or want something quick but 
                delicious to eat, this is my go to! I have cooked it so many times this past semester, and it has been super yummy each time! 
                Sometimes I eat it with rice and sometimes I don't; if you are watching blood sugar levels, definitely try to pass on the rice!
