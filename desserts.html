        <p class = 'dish_intro'> Soy milk is an especially popular beverage in many East Asian countries, and is often served during breakfast! It isn't super popular in Western countries, but I grew up drinking it and personally really like it! 
            Having soy milk with a little bit of sugar in it and eating potstickers is one of my favorite meals to have when I used to visit my family in Taiwan.
            Making soy milk at home is also fun and relatively easy to do at home! All you need is soybeans and water, and a blender and strainer!

                    <div class="card__face card__face--back">Soybeans contain a lot of bioactive compounds that are very good for human health. They have been shown to lower blood pressure, improve blood vessel health, and improve bone health! They are also digested slowly by the body, which helps to regulate blood sugar levels.

            <figcaption>Some people like to add rice cakes!</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class = 'dish_intro'> Red bean soup is something that I have also been eating since I was little, and I always have very fond memories of eating it! 
            Red bean is a very classic flavor and taste in my opinion and pairs well with many desserts. 
            For instance, you can find it in many breads, cakes, and it often pairs well with matcha! 
            Red bean soup however is a simple dessert/beverage using just red bean, water, and a little bit of sugar though, but it is still a very yummy treat! 
            Sugar is often added, but the beans themselves also have a lot of flavor so you can get away with adding little to no sugar.
